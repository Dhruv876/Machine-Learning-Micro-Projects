# Prediction-of-liver-fibrosis-
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects more than 170 million people worldwide. Egypt has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C in the world with prevalence rates reaching 13%-15%. Thus, HCV represents a major public health and economic problem in Egypt. HCV infection is marked by high tendency to persistence and evolution to chronic hepatitis with development of serious consequences such as cirrhosis and liver cancer in some patients. The aim of this project is to use statistical learning to predict liver fibrosis by discovering the hidden predictive patterns from medical databases.
